# Instructions
- Run program from terminal: ```python main.py```
- Create, delete, start, stop and track costs of machines as you desire.

# Future
- For now machines can be created when running the program, but will be deleted when the program finishes. Support should be added to keep previous created machines and their information in a separate json file or DB.
